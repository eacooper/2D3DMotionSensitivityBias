Each mat file contains a data matrix for one of the experimental conditions. Each row is a single trial, columns are as follows:

(1) condition number (1 = near, 2 = mid, 3 = far, 4 = monocular)
(2) participant number (1-6)
(3) angular location in the visual field (90 = upper visual field, 270 = lower visual field)
(4) speed (deg/sec/eye)
(5) direction (towards/left = -1 away/right = 1) 
(6) participant response (towards/left = -1 away/right = 1) 

Also included is a fusible stereo movie illustrating two trials from the experiment.
